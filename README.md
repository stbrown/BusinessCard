A 7 time startup founder with a proven history of taking companies from inception to exit. As the founder/CEO/CTO of companies like bounce.io, Kronovia, ColdSpark and others, Scott knows first hand the challenges of building software for the real world. An engineer at heart, Scott still spends part of every week writing code and scaling the business.
